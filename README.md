# zsh-rand-string

This is a simple zsh plugin that allows you to create a random string of youre desired length. I got tired of creating random strings for secrets so I wanted to create an easy way to create one from the CLI.

# Clone the random-string plugin repository

git clone https://github.com/foresthpark/zsh-rand-string ~/.zsh/plugins/rand-string

# Load the random-string plugin

source ~/.zsh/plugins/random-string/random-string.plugin.zsh


# Run the plugin

```
$ rand-string 12
// result: !k&nx1sdQrnf
```
